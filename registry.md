We love our tiny house in Santa Barbara, however because it is so tiny, and so very far from Washougal, a big stack of gifts will not at all be practical.

So we are doing something a little different. We have set up three funds which you may choose to contribute to as a wedding gift:

<ol>
  <li><a href="http://registered.at/gunndean">Honeymoon</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://registered.at/gunndean">Baby</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://registered.at/gunndean">House Deposit</a></li>
</ol>

 Whichever you contribute to, we promise to set aside that money for that particular thing, and think of you fondly as we enjoy it. Whether that be soaking in the blue lagoons of Iceland and hiking the highlands of Scotland, picking up baby toys, or writing a monthly mortgage check.

You can think of it like a choose-you-own-adventure game, where we get to play and you get to fund the adventure. Great right?

If you don't like sending money over the internet, you are welcome to bring an envelope with cash or check to the wedding. Please write your preference (honeymoon, baby, or house deposit) in the envelope.

If you have something that you <em>really really</em> want to give to us, you may, and we will find a way to get it home. Or if it is china we will store it at our parents till we get that house. Honestly though, we'd prefer the house.

We love you all and can't wait to see you on our happy day in September.

<3 Josh + Aaron
